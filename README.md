# classification-feature-engineering
Machine learning classification problem with an anonymous 100 feature data set. The goal is prediction skill based on AUC. EDA, data cleaning, pipelines, model selection, feature engineering, parameter tuning.

- This is a dirty data set that includes several entries where values have been deleted. Note that some of the missing values are truly blank (unknown answers). Success will likely involve feature engineering and avoiding data leakage.

- Selecting different machine learning models and tuning parameters to predict the value for y.  

- Predictions output as class probabilities for belonging to the positive class.  
 
- Comparison of the pros and cons of the modeling techniques. What might be different in a business context?

- EDA, cleaning, prepping, and modeling.

- Model performance on the data hold out measured by AUC.
